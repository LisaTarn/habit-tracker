# habit-track
Project purpose: Habit Track is a companion dashboard for building healthy habits.  Our website helps you log four habits (exercise, fruit and vegetable intake, cups of water, and hours of sleep), then displays the data in a chart, so that you can view your progress.

### Registration/Login:
The user can then go to the registration page where they put in their name, email and password.  From there, the page redirects to a login page where the name and password need to match for the user to login.  Once the name and password match the user is directed to the dashboard.
