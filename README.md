The user starts at the homepage where they view the About Us section. They can then scroll down and get various motivational quotes, and if they keep on scrolling down there is a contact section.

The user can then go to the registration page where they put in their name, email and password.  From there, the page redirects to a login page where the name and password need to match for the user to login.  Once the name and password match the user is directed to the dashboard.

In the dashboards, the user can input their data, and the day of the data.  There are 4 charts, one for each habit.
